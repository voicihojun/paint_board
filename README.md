# paint_board

paint board building with vanilla js

What I learn!

1. By using reset.css, initialize css in order for user to identically be looked from all browser.

2. Through using many context library, I learn each library's property and how to use it.
   (fillStyle, strokeStyle, fillRect, lineWidth, beginPath(), moveTo(x, y), lineto(x, y), stroke(), closePath())

3. To download canvas's image, we should use 'a' tag. In the tag, there are download attribute aand href attribute. Download attribute is for the name of the saved image , and href is the link for the image.
